# Strategy System

The strategy system is responsible for determining and executing strategies for AI and remote players. It provides a flexible way to implement different types of AI behaviors and to handle remote player actions.

## Components

### Strategy Planner

The `StrategyPlanner` is the main entry point for the strategy system. It creates and manages strategy providers based on the selected strategy source (AI, Remote, or Dummy).

```csharp
// Example usage
var strategyPlanner = new StrategyPlanner(StrategySource.Dummy, player);
StartCoroutine(strategyPlanner.ExecuteNextStrategyCoroutine(board));
```

### Strategy Providers

Strategy providers are responsible for generating strategies based on the current game state. The system includes the following providers:

- `DummyStrategyProvider`: Provides predefined strategies for testing purposes.
- `AIStrategyProvider`: Uses AI to generate strategies based on the current game state.
- `RemoteStrategyProvider`: Receives strategies from a remote player.

### Strategy

A `Strategy` represents a sequence of decisions to be executed in order. It is generated by a strategy provider and executed by the strategy planner.

### Decision

A `Decision` represents a single action to be performed on the board, such as deploying a card, attacking with a card, or using a card ability.

## Usage

To use the strategy system, create a `StrategyPlanner` with the desired strategy source and player:

```csharp
var strategyPlanner = new StrategyPlanner(StrategySource.Dummy, player);
```

Then, to execute a strategy:

```csharp
StartCoroutine(strategyPlanner.ExecuteNextStrategyCoroutine(board));
```

This will get the next strategy from the strategy provider and execute it on the board.

## Events

The strategy planner provides the following events:

- `OnStrategyDetermined`: Raised when a strategy is determined by the strategy provider.
- `OnDecisionExecuting`: Raised before a decision is executed.
- `OnDecisionExecuted`: Raised after a decision is executed.

These events can be used to update the UI or to perform additional actions when a strategy is executed.
