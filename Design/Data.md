# Kardx System Data Design

## Overview

This document details the enhanced data system design for a [Kards](https://kards.com)-alike card game. The design emphasizes modularity, a data-driven approach to abilities, and extensibility by clearly separating the following layers:

- **Data Layer**: Manages static card definitions, zones, and base attributes.
- **Logic Layer**: Handles game rules, turn phases, and the dynamic application of card abilities and effects.
- **UI Layer**: Presents the data to the player while supporting animations, lazy-loaded images (using WebP), and responsive design.

Game designers can now add or modify abilities simply by updating JSON configurations, which enhances iteration speed and flexibility.

## Card Definitions

### Card Type

Each card is defined by a static type that serves as a blueprint for all of its instances. The updated CardType now includes metadata for localization, resource cost, rarity, and associated abilities.

```cs
public class CardType
{
    public string Id; // Unique identifier (GUID or slug)
    public string NameKey; // Localization key for the card name
    public string DescriptionKey; // Localization key for the card description
    public string Category; // e.g., Creature, Spell, Artifact, etc.
    public string Subtype; // Archetype (e.g., Warrior, Mage)
    public int Cost; // Resource cost to play the card
    public int Health; // Base health of the card
    public int Attack; // Attack power of the card
    public int CounterAttack; // Power used for counterattacks
    public int Rarity; // e.g., Common = 1, Rare = 2, Epic = 3, Legendary = 4
    public string SetId; // Card edition or set identifier
    public string ImageUrl; // Optimized WebP image URL with size metadata
    public Dictionary<string, int> Attributes; // Additional base attributes (e.g., health, speed)
    public List<AbilityDefinition> Abilities; // Ability definitions associated with the card
}
```

### Card Instance

A card instance represents a live card in the systemâ€”whether in a deck, hand, or on the battlefield. In addition to linking back to the static definition, the instance maintains dynamic state such as current level, modifiers, and computed attributes.

```cs
public class Card
{
    public Guid InstanceId;        // Unique instance identifier
    public CardType CardType;      // Reference to the static card definition
    public int Level;
    public int Experience;
    public string OwnerId;
    public string ControllerId;
    public List<Modifier> Modifiers; // Active temporary modifiers (buffs/debuffs)
    public Dictionary<string, int> DynamicAttributes; // Computed attributes (from buffs, equipment, etc.)
    public int Health; // Current health of the card
}
```

### Modifier

Modifiers are temporary stat changes that can be applied to cards. They are used to implement card abilities and effects.

```cs
public class Modifier {
    public string SourceCardId;  // Identifier for the card that applied the modifier
    public int RemainingTurns;   // Number of turns the modifier will last
    public int Value;            // The value of the modifier (e.g., +2 attack)
    public string Attribute;     // The attribute being modified (e.g., "attack", "defense")
    public ModifierType Type;    // Type of modifier (e.g., Buff, Debuff)

    public bool IsActive() {
        // Determine if the modifier is currently active based on conditions
    }

    public void ApplyEffect(Card targetCard) {
        // Apply the modifier's effect to the target card
    }

    public void Expire() {
        // Handle expiration logic, such as removing the modifier from the target
    }
}
```

## Data-Driven Ability System

Card abilities are defined as data, enabling designers to adjust functionality without code changes. Abilities include triggers, costs, visual effects, and preconditions.

### Ability Definition

```cs
public class AbilityDefinition
{
    public string Id;          // Unique ability identifier (e.g., "ambush")
    public string Trigger;     // Event that activates the ability (e.g., "onDeployment")
    public string Category;    // Ability type (e.g., "tactic", "passive")
    public int Cost;           // Resource cost to activate
    public string Target;      // Targeting scope (e.g., "enemy", "ally", "self")
    public EffectDefinition Effect; // Effect to apply when triggered
    public List<Condition> Conditions; // Activation requirements
    public int? Cooldown;      // Cooldown configuration - if null, no cooldown
}

public class Condition
{
    public string Type;    // Condition type (e.g., "zone", "healthThreshold")
    public string Value;   // Condition value (e.g., "forest", "50")
    public string Operator; // Optional comparison operator for numeric conditions
}
```

The following is an example of a condition:

```json
{
  "type": "zone",
  "value": "forest",
  "operator": "=="
}
```

### Effect Definition

The effect definition specifies how the ability's impact is calculated and applied. The dynamic calculation can incorporate multiple attributes from the caster.

Effect types:

- `damage`: Deals damage to a target card.
- `heal`: Heals a target card.
- `buff`: Applies a buff to a target card.
- `debuff`: Applies a debuff to a target card.

You can also define custom effect types by extending the `EffectDefinition` class.

```cs
public class EffectDefinition
{
    public string Type;         // Effect type (e.g., "damage", "heal", "buff")
    public string Target;       // "single", "area", "self"
    public string Formula;      // Mathematical formula for effect calculation
    public List<EffectAttribute> Attributes; // Parameters used in the formula
    public int? Cooldown;       // Turns until reuse (null = no cooldown)
    public string Animation;    // Reference to visual effect
    public string Sound;        // Reference to audio effect
}

public class EffectAttribute
{
    public string Name;  // Attribute identifier (e.g., "base", "multiplier")
    public object Value; // Can be int, float, or string reference
}
```

The following is an example of an ambush ability:

```json
{
  "type": "damage",
  "target": "single",
  "formula": "base + (caster.magic * multiplier) + (caster.attack * bonusFactor)",
  "attributes": [
    { "name": "base", "value": 5 },
    { "name": "multiplier", "value": 1.5 },
    { "name": "bonusFactor", "value": 0.5 }
  ],
  "cooldown": 2,
  "animation": "explosion_anim",
  "sound": "damage_sound"
}
```

Key features:

1. `Formula` uses mathematical expressions with attributes from both caster and target
2. `Attributes` provide configurable parameters for the formula
3. `Value` is `object` to support different data types (int, float, string references)
4. Nullable `Cooldown` matches the design document's conditional cooldown logic

## Rule Engine and Effect Application

The rule engine dynamically interprets and applies ability effects based on their JSON definitions. It validates conditions, computes effect values, and alters game state accordingly.

```cs
public class RuleEngine
{
    public int CalculateEffect(EffectDefinition effect, Card caster)
    {
        // Parse the calculation expression (e.g., using an expression parser)
        // Evaluate "base + (caster.magic * multiplier) + (caster.attack * bonusFactor)"
        // Return the computed numeric result.
    }

    public void ApplyEffect(EffectDefinition effect, Card caster, Card target)
    {
        // Evaluate any prerequisites and then apply the calculated effect value
        // Update the target card's state (e.g., damage, buffs/debuffs).
    }

    public bool ValidateAbilityConditions(List<Condition> conditions, Card card)
    {
        // Check if all conditions (resource cost, cooldowns, etc.) pass
        // Return true if the card is permitted to use this ability.
    }

    public void TriggerAbility(AbilityDefinition ability, Card caster, Card target)
    {
        if (ValidateAbilityConditions(ability.Conditions, caster))
        {
            ApplyEffect(ability.Effect, caster, target);
            // Optionally initiate visual effects, sound, and set ability cooldown.
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Usage

Below is an updated example showing how to define and trigger an ambush ability using the proper class definitions:

```cs
// Define a ambush ability with dynamic scaling
var ambushAbility = new AbilityDefinition {
    Id = "ambush",
    Trigger = "onDeployment",
    Cost = 2,
    Target = "enemy",
    Effect = new EffectDefinition {
        Type = "damage",
        Formula = "base + (caster.stealth * multiplier)",
        Attributes = new List<EffectAttribute> {
            new EffectAttribute { Name = "base", Value = 3 },
            new EffectAttribute { Name = "multiplier", Value = 1.2 }
        },
        Animation = "ambush_anim",
        Sound = "ambush_sound"
    },
    Conditions = new List<Condition> {
        new Condition {
            Type = "zone",
            Value = "forest",
            Operator = "=="
        }
    },
    Cooldown = 1
};

// Calculate the damage using the rule engine and apply the ability
int damage = ruleEngine.CalculateEffect(ambushAbility.Effect, caster);
ruleEngine.TriggerAbility(ambushAbility, caster, target);
```

## Zones and Board State

The board state manages separate game zones for each player and shared game areas. This ensures proper isolation of player-specific card collections while maintaining shared game elements.

```cs
public struct PlayerState {
    public Stack<Card> Deck;          // Private draw pile (random access via shuffle)
    public List<Card> Hand;           // Current playable cards (max 10)
    public Dictionary<Position, Card> Battlefield; // Played cards with positioning
    public Queue<Card> DiscardPile;   // Public graveyard (last-in ordering)
    public int ActionPoints;          // Action points available for the player
    public Card Headquarter;          // Special card representing the player's headquarter
}

public class BoardState {
    public Dictionary<string, PlayerState> Players; // Key: player ID
    public SharedZones Global;        // Neutral game areas
    public List<GameEffect> ActiveEffects; // Ongoing game-wide effects
}

public class SharedZones {
    public Stack<Card> NeutralDeck;   // Environment/quest cards
    public List<Card> Exile;          // Removed-from-game cards
    public List<Card> Limbo;          // Cards in transition between zones
}

```

Key considerations:

1. Separate zones per player (deck/hand/battlefield/discard)
2. Clear distinction between player-specific and shared zones
3. Added hand zone with maximum size constraint
4. Explicit exile zone for removed cards
5. Positional battlefield with grid coordinates
6. Transitional limbo zone for cards moving between areas.

The concept of a "Limbo" zone in card games typically refers to a temporary state where cards are in transition between different zones or states. This can be useful for handling complex game mechanics where cards need to be temporarily removed from play but are not yet in their final destination zone.

Example usage:

```cs
var board = new BoardState {
    Players = new Dictionary<string, PlayerState> {
        ["P1"] = new PlayerState {
            Deck = new Stack<Card>(p1Deck),
            Hand = new List<Card>(),
            Battlefield = new Dictionary<Position, Card>(),
            DiscardPile = new Queue<Card>(),
            ActionPoints = 10,
            Headquarter = p1Headquarter
        },
        ["P2"] = new PlayerState { /* ... */ }
    },
    Global = new SharedZones {
        NeutralDeck = new Stack<Card>(environmentCards),
        Exile = new List<Card>(),
        Limbo = new List<Card>()
    }
};
```

## Battle System

The battle system is straightforward, with players taking turns to perform actions. Each player can spend points to move cards, attack, or enhance their cards. The game is won when a player's headquarters card, which is always on the battlefield, is reduced to zero health.

```cs
public class BattleManager {
    public BoardState Board { get; private set; }
    public int TurnNumber { get; private set; }
    public string CurrentTurnPlayerId { get; private set; }

    public void StartBattle(Player player1, Player player2) {
        // Initializes the board state and sets up the initial conditions for the battle.
        CurrentTurnPlayerId = player1.Id; // Start with player 1
        Board.Players[player1.Id].ActionPoints = 10; // Example starting action points
        Board.Players[player2.Id].ActionPoints = 10; // Example starting action points
    }

    public void MoveCard(Card card, Zone targetZone) {
        // Check if the player has enough action points to move the card
        if (Board.Players[CurrentTurnPlayerId].ActionPoints >= card.Cost) {
            // Deduct action points
            Board.Players[CurrentTurnPlayerId].ActionPoints -= card.Cost;

            // Move the card to the target zone
            // Implement logic to update the card's position in the game state

            // Handle any immediate effects of moving the card
            ApplyCardEffects(card, targetZone);
        } else {
            // Notify the player that they don't have enough action points
        }
    }

    public void Attack(Card attacker, Card target) {
        // Check if the player has enough action points to attack
        if (Board.Players[CurrentTurnPlayerId].ActionPoints >= attacker.Cost) {
            // Deduct action points
            Board.Players[CurrentTurnPlayerId].ActionPoints -= attacker.Cost;

            // Calculate damage and apply it to both cards
            int damageToTarget = CalculateDamage(attacker, target);
            int damageToAttacker = CalculateDamage(target, attacker);

            target.Health -= damageToTarget;
            attacker.Health -= damageToAttacker;

            // Check if any cards are destroyed
            CheckCardDestruction(attacker);
            CheckCardDestruction(target);
        } else {
            // Notify the player that they don't have enough action points
        }
    }

    public void EndTurn() {
        // Add action points for the current player, capped at 9.
        Board.Players[CurrentTurnPlayerId].ActionPoints = Math.Min(Board.Players[CurrentTurnPlayerId].ActionPoints + 5, 9);
        // Finalizes the current turn, processing any necessary end-of-turn effects.
        CurrentTurnPlayerId = GetOpponentId(CurrentTurnPlayerId);
        TurnNumber++;
    }

    private void ApplyCardEffects(Card source, Card target) {
        // Implement logic to apply any effects triggered by moving the card
    }

    private int CalculateDamage(Card attacker, Card target) {
        // Implement logic to calculate damage based on card attributes
        return attacker.AttackPower; // Example calculation
    }

    private void CheckCardDestruction(Card card) {
        if (card.Health <= 0) {
            // Remove the card from the game state and apply any destruction effects.
        }
    }

    private string GetOpponentId(string playerId) {
        // Returns the ID of the opponent player based on the current player's ID.
    }
}
```
