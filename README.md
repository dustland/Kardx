# Kardx

Kardx is a reference implementation of a Kards-alike card game. This project is built solely for educational purposes to showcase the design and implementation of a card game. Commercial use of this project is not allowed.

## Design

The design of the game is based on the following principles:

- **Data-Driven**: The game is designed to be data-driven, meaning that the game's logic is defined in data, i.e. in the form of cards and board states.
- **Modular**: The game is designed to be modular, meaning that the game's logic is defined in data, i.e. in the form of cards and board states.
- **Extensible**: The game is designed to be extensible, meaning that new cards and board states can be easily added to the game.

This project is explained in the following documents:

- [Data Design](./Design/Data.md)

## Development

Other than Unity 6 (v6000.0.38f1), you will need to install these additional dependencies in Unity:

- [Edit with Windsurf](https://github.com/Asuta/com.unity.ide.windsurf) - Install from Git URL: https://github.com/Asuta/com.unity.ide.windsurf.git.windsurf.git
- [NewtonSoft JSON](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) - Add from package manager: `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`

Windsurf has much better performance comparing to Cursor IDE.

## Implementation

This project is built using the Unity 6 (v6000.0.38f1) game engine and Cursor IDE. Please make sure to use the same version to avoid any compatibility issues.
